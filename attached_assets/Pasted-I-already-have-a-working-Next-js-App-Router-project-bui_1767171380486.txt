I already have a working Next.js (App Router) project built on Replit.

Current status:
- Replit Auth is already implemented for café owners (admin only).
- Digital menu CRUD is already implemented (categories + items).
- Public users (customers) scan QR and view the digital menu (no auth).
- Frontend is deployed on Vercel.
- Backend logic is inside Next.js API routes to reduce hosting cost.

Now I want you to implement ONLY the remaining features listed below.
DO NOT redesign or rebuild existing digital menu logic.

====================================
FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
====================================

1) SUBSCRIPTION + FREE TRIAL (RAZORPAY TEST MODE)

- Use Razorpay in TEST MODE.
- Each café gets:
  - 7 days FREE TRIAL after signup.
  - After trial ends, menu page should still load BUT show a banner:
    "Subscription expired. Please renew."
- Create a subscription model in MongoDB with:
  - cafeId
  - plan ("trial" | "active" | "expired")
  - trialEndsAt
  - subscriptionEndsAt
- Razorpay payment flow:
  - Button in admin dashboard: "Upgrade to Paid Plan"
  - After successful payment:
    - Update subscriptionEndsAt (30 days)
    - Mark plan as "active"
- Use Razorpay TEST keys only.
- Implement Razorpay order creation API route.
- Implement Razorpay payment verification API route.
- No production keys.

2) IMAGE MENU OPTION (ALONGSIDE DIGITAL MENU)

- Add a menuType field in café model:
  - "digital" | "image"
- Admin dashboard:
  - Toggle switch to select menu type.
- IMAGE MENU FLOW:
  - Admin can upload ONE menu image (their printed menu photo).
  - Store image in Cloudinary.
  - Save Cloudinary image URL in MongoDB.
- Customer side:
  - If menuType === "image" → show the image full-width (mobile-first).
  - If menuType === "digital" → show existing digital menu.
- QR code URL must remain the SAME.
- Switching menu type must instantly affect the public menu page.

3) CLOUDINARY IMAGE STORAGE

- Use Cloudinary for image uploads.
- Only for IMAGE MENU (not digital menu items).
- Use environment variables for Cloudinary.
- Add secure upload handling in API route.

====================================
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
====================================

- Use Next.js App Router + API routes only.
- No separate Express server.
- No new auth system (use existing Replit Auth).
- No table-level QR codes.
- No analytics.
- No redesign of UI unless required.
- Keep code minimal and clean.

====================================
OUTPUT REQUIRED
====================================

- MongoDB schema changes.
- API routes for:
  - Razorpay order creation
  - Razorpay verification
  - Cloudinary image upload
- Admin UI changes (toggle + upload + subscription button).
- Public menu page logic update.
- Clear comments explaining logic.

Do NOT add extra features.
Do NOT remove existing digital menu.
Implement only what is requested.
